Most efforts to understand the evolution of seasonal influenza A/H3N2's surface protein, hemagglutinin (HA), focus on mutations that increase viral fitness by enabling escape from the immune system.
We investigated the functional effects of all possible single amino-acid mutations to the HA of a single, recent H3N2 strain in laboratory conditions.
We found that mutations with neutral or beneficial effects in the lab were often successful in nature, while mutations with deleterious effects were not.
