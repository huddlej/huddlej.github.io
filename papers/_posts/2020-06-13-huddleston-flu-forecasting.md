Rapid mutation of seasonal influenza's hemagglutinin protein allows viruses to escape our adaptive immunity necessitating regular vaccine updates.
We developed a novel framework that forecasts influenza evolution by combining fitness estimates from experimental assays and genomic data.
We found that experimental measurements of antigenic drift provide more accurate forecasts than genomic data alone.
