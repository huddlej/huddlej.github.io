The high-throughput technique of deep mutational scanning (DMS) has recently made it possible to experimentally measure the effects of all amino-acid mutations to a protein.
We developed an interactive visualization tool, <a href="https://dms-view.github.io/">dms-view</a>, to enable dynamic exploration of DMS data in linked views with other site-level data and 3D protein structures.
