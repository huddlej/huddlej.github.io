Real-time analysis of human pathogen evolution requires a diverse collection of bioinformatics tools to infer transmission dynamics and make recommendations to public health officials.
These tools must scale with the number of samples and be flexible enough to adapt to a variety of questions and organisms.
To meet these needs, we developed Augur, a bioinformatics toolkit designed for phylogenetic analyses of human pathogens.
